<p><%= link_to "Typefighters by Team Rubades", entries_path(25) %> won this year's Judge's Favorite award. It's a realtime game where you try and type sentences faster than your opponent. They used lots of Hotwire features to run animations and broadcast the game state in realtime. It is a really fun entry.</p>

<h2>Best Solo / Community Favorite</h2>
<%= link_to image_tag("winners/checkpoint-rails.gif", class: "max-w-lg"), entries_path(9) %>
<p><%= link_to "Checkpoint Rails", entries_path(9) %> won both the <b>Best Solo</b> and <b>Community Favorite</b> awards. It's an excellent project aiming to help Rails developers debug what happens during a request. It uses TracePoint and Rails's Instrumentation to display a graph of method calls during a Rails request. And it was all built by Jim Jones on his own over 48 hours!</p>

<h2>Most Phlex-ible</h2>
<%= link_to image_tag("winners/hottable.png", class: "max-w-lg"), entries_path(6) %>
<p><%= link_to "Hot Table", entries_path(6) %> won the Most Phlex-ible award. Their team implemented a full-featured Airtable clone with Hotwire and used Phlex components in a weekend. It was the most complete and polished entry of the whole Hackathon. Tremendous work!</p>

<h2>Kent Believe He Finished</h2>
<%= link_to image_tag("winners/kentstagram.png", class: "max-w-lg"), entries_path(10) %>
<p>Always a jokester, our beloved Kent submitted <%= link_to "Kentstagram", entries_path(10) %> so we thought we'd come up with a Kentatstic award for him: the Kent Believe He Finished award. ðŸ˜œ</p>
